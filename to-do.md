TODO

- Go through and implement everything in the tidy text mining book chapter
  by chapter. In particular, looking at bi and tri grams may be interesting
- - Do tf_idf stat
- - Look into positive vs negative word cloud
- Look into frequency of word orange in Bucks dataset
- Add filters for case numbers, aggregated statistics, sentiment analysis 
  graphed by the eight emotions

DONE
- How I did "dominate emotion is flawed", anticipation comes up more
  because it's the first in the list but at sometimes each word has the same
  score. However, doing an alternative analysis of each emotion seperately
  actually confirmed what I found with the biased approach so this can be
  ignored for now
- Create Shiny Dashboard to make viewing cases easier
