# What is your optimal k?
#   In the last exercise you made a scree plot, showing the ratio of the within cluster sum of squares to the total sum of squares.
# You want to choose k such that your clusters are compact and well separated. However, the ratio_ss keeps decreasing as k increases. Hence, if you were to minimize this ratio as function of k, youâ€™d end up with a cluster for every school, which is a meaningless result. You should choose k such that when increasing it, the impact on ratio_ss is not significant. The elbow in the scree plot will help you identify this turning point.
# Can you tell which of the following values of k will provide a meaningful clustering with overall compact and well separated clusters? The ratio, ratio_ss, is still in your workspace.
# 3 or 4
# The plot shows a considerable drop for k equal to 3. Furthermore, the ratio_ss for k equal to 2 is higher than 20%.

  km <- kmeans(df, k)
  ratio_ss[k] <- km$tot.withinss / km$totss
