Exploring the NUFORC dataset that shows UFO/UAP reports up to December 2021

## What is This?

I thought it would be fun to explore the NUFORC dataset to see if any of the data science techniques we have can be applied to the UFO phenomenon. This is something I'm doing as a series on my [@mattjcamp blog](https://mattjcamp.com) partly for fun and partly to learn more about data science.

But, I also want to start to find a way to seriously investigate the UFO/UAP phenomenon. There is probably a limit to what you can realistically gleam from doing large scale statistical analysis of self-reported UFO sightings. But, who knows maybe something will pop out. Of course, this type of analysis probably won't answer the big questions around the topic.

## How to Follow Along

I've organized the broad steps I'm taking into numbered folders, so the best thing to do is start at step 1 and run the code. I've not saved the data itself here in the repo so you will have to use the data.world API yourself (see step 01). I'm also writing up various topics on my blog, although the code will not be rehashed there unless I find something particularly interesting technically.
